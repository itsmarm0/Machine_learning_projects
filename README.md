# Diamond Dataset AnalysisðŸ’Ž

Project Overview:
This project presents a detailed review and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Diamond Dataset, followed by the application of various machine learning algorithms to predict diamond prices based on their attributes. The dataset includes features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and price.

Methodology
Data Cleaning: Removed missing values and standardized categorical features.

Feature Exploration: Analyzed distributions and relationships between features using plots and summary statistics.

Correlation Analysis: Identified strong relationships, especially between carat and price.

Machine Learning Models:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Used for regression tasks. Performance was sensitive to the choice of k and feature scaling. KNN captured local patterns but struggled with outliers.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) Applied with different kernels. SVM showed strong performance in capturing nonlinear relationships but required careful tuning of hyperparameters.

Linear Regression Served as a baseline model. It highlighted the linear dependency between carat and price but was limited in capturing complex interactions.

Decision Tree & Random Forest These tree-based models handled categorical features well and provided insights into feature importance. Random Forest improved generalization and reduced overfitting.
...

Key Findings:
Carat is the most influential feature in determining price.

Cut, color, and clarity have noticeable but less dominant effects.

Ensemble models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting outperformed simpler models in accuracy and robustness.
