# Diamond Dataset 

Project Overview:
This project was an experiment on Diamond Dataset.It was followed by the application of machine learning algorithms to predict diamond prices based on their attributes. The dataset includes features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and price.

Machine Learning Models used:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Used for regression tasks. KNN was sensitive to the choice of k and feature scaling.It captured local patterns but struggled with outliers.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) with different kernels: SVM showed strong performance in capturing nonlinear relationships but required careful tuning of hyperparameters.

Linear Regression: It highlighted the linear dependency between carat and price but was limited in capturing complex interactions.

Decision Tree & Random Forest: They handled categorical features well and provided insights into feature importance. Random Forest improved generalization and reduced overfitting.
